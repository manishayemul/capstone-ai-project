This project is an Agentic AI system built as part of the Ciklum AI Academy.

The system uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), tool-based reasoning,
reflection, and evaluation to autonomously analyze context and generate
professional LinkedIn-style posts.

The agent retrieves contextual information, reasons about it,
executes tools, critiques its own output, and scores performance.
